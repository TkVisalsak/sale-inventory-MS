  * Shows current quantity of each product per location/warehouse.
  * Columns: Product, Category, Supplier, Unit, Quantity, Location, Value.

  * Items below a minimum threshold to trigger purchase/reorder.
* **Out-of-Stock Report**

  * Products completely depleted, important for sales planning.

  * Inventory value by product, category, or warehouse.
  * Supports accounting and financial reports (FIFO, LIFO, or average costing).

If you want, I can **draft a full enterprise inventory reporting structure** for your system, mapping **each report to your current tabs** (Products, Categories, Batches, Transfers, Adjustments, Sales) and suggest **UI layout with dashboard cards** like your Sales/Inventory overview page.

Do you want me to do that next?
